The test is composed of 4 independent exercises. You can launch it by installing
the yarn dependencies and run `yarn start`.  

- Exercise 1 is about html layout  
- Exercise 2 is about developing and debugging basic React  
- Exercise 3 is about more advanced react features with ux and performance
concerns

For each exercise we will evaluate the final result and the quality of the code written.
